# LNP-Web-GUI-K8s-Deployment
This is a yaml package for installing the LNP server that can be found on https://github.com/haim9798/lnp_api

This will deploy the code in branch lnp_api_k8


This package includes deployment for a website that can be used to configrue and query the LNP server along with it. 

In order to build this you need to create the services and then create the deployments. 

This was tested under minikube only!
